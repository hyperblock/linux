    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para><command>create_compressed_fs</command> compresses a filesystem image
        to a compressed image suitable for mounting with the hbloop driver.
    </para>
    <para><command>extract_compressed_fs</command> uncompresses a filesystem image
        created by create_compressed_fs.

    <title>OPTIONS</title>
    <para>
        Run the <command>create_compressed_fs</command> 
        command with "-h" to get a list of available options and description of data
        storages modes and advanced usage (eg. with a network cluster). Blocksize
        must be a multiple of 512 bytes.
    </para>
    <para>
       There is an alternative set of options which is supported for
       compatibility with the original version of create_compressed_fs. When
       it's called with a pure number as output, it assumes the old syntax and
       maps the default options to memory mode and the block size to the
       number. -b for best mode is recognized as well.

    <title>NOTES</title>
    <para>
        For optimal performance, create_compressed_fs should be used with real
        input and output files.
     </para>
     <para>
        Operation with STDIN or STDOUT is complicated. create_compressed_fs
        cannot operate as a simple pipe filter because it needs to know some
        things in advance: a) the data length, b) the block lengths calculated
        during the compression. This meta data needs to be stored in the header
        AFTER the compression is trough, therefore it is not possible to push
        all generated data to STDOUT on-the-fly.
     </para>
     <para>
        And so compromises need to be made. The simpliest method (used by the
        ancient create_compressed_fs) is a big temporary memory buffer (option
        <option>-m</option>) to keep compressed data in RAM. However, the
        overall system performance suffers from such usage and this may drive
        other applications into OOM conditions.
     </para>
     <para>
        The next alternative to this is storing the temprorary data in an extra
        file aside (the <option>-f</option> option). This improves the overall
        system performance but create_compressed_fs operation is slower because
        it needs to copy data back when it's finished. Plus, double disk space
        for the output is required. If disk space is limited, the
        <option>-r</option> option could be used (reusing output file for
        temporary data), however the speed of the copy-back step may decrease
        significantly.
     </para>
     <para>
        There are strategies to avoid the temporary data storage completely.
        First, only files should be used. If that is not possible, then the
        output should be a (seekable) file and the input data length should be
        known (either specified with the <option>-s</option> option or detected from the input
        file size).
     </para>
     <para>
        Second, it is possible to store the header of the hbloop volume in a
        separate file. After the work, header can be merged together with the
        compressed data with the cat command. The output data can be written to
        stdout. Since the header is stored too late, this method is not very
        usefull for immediate data transfer.  However, it allows to do some
        tricks like piping to the split utility (to store DVD images in smaller
        files on VFAT) or piping data trough ssh if the local system has no
        disk space (and copying the header separately).

  <title>MOUNTING</title>
  <para>You can pass an option to the hbloop module on loading, or use losetup or losetup functionality of the mount command. Examples:</para>

  <para>insmod hbloop.o file=/path/to/compressed/image</para>
  <para>losetup /dev/hbloop1 /path/to/compressed/image</para>
  <para>mount -o ro -t whatever /dev/hbloop /mnt/compressed</para>
  <para>mount cl /mnt/misc -oloop=/dev/hbloop0</para>
